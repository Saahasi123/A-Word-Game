# A-Word-Game
Here I made a piece of code where you can guess a word or the word, and it will show you that letter with dashes surrounding it. 
An example: The word is hello, if you guess h it will say h----
it will also tell how many guesses you took and your points. Get a guess right and thats 1 point, of you dont yyou get no points
